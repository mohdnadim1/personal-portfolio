## **Step 1: Planning Your Portfolio Website**

Before you start coding, itâ€™s important to plan your websiteâ€™s structure and content. A well-organized portfolio should include:

- **Homepage**: An introduction to who you are, your expertise, and a brief overview of your work.
- **Projects Section**: A display of your best work with links to source code and live demos.
- **Resume or CV**: A downloadable or online version of your resume.
- **Contact Form**: A way for visitors to get in touch with you.
- **Social Media Links**: Links to GitHub, LinkedIn, Twitter, or other relevant platforms.
- **Blog (Optional)**: A section to share insights, tutorials, or thoughts on your field.

### **Wireframing Your Portfolio**
To visualize your website layout, use tools like:

- **Figma** (https://www.figma.com/)
- **Adobe XD** (https://www.adobe.com/products/xd.html)
- **Balsamiq** (https://balsamiq.com/)
- **Pen and paper** (for a quick sketch)

## **Step 2: Setting Up the Project Folder**

Create a structured folder for your project:

```
portfolio-website/
   â”œâ”€â”€ index.html        (Main landing page)
   â”œâ”€â”€ style.css         (Stylesheet for design)
   â”œâ”€â”€ script.js         (JavaScript file for interactivity)
   â”œâ”€â”€ images/           (Folder for images and icons)
   â”œâ”€â”€ projects.html     (Page for portfolio projects)
   â”œâ”€â”€ contact.html      (Contact form page)
   â”œâ”€â”€ README.md         (Project description)
   â”œâ”€â”€ assets/           (Fonts, additional media files)
   â”œâ”€â”€ css/              (Separate CSS files for organization)
   â”œâ”€â”€ js/               (Separate JavaScript files for modularity)
```

Organizing files into folders helps maintain scalability as your website grows.

## **Step 3: Creating the HTML Structure**

### **Basic HTML Structure (`index.html`)**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>My Portfolio</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css">
</head>
<body>
    <header>
        <h1>Welcome to My Portfolio</h1>
        <nav>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="index.html">Home</a></li>
                <li><a href="projects.html">Projects</a></li>
                <li><a href="contact.html">Contact</a></li>
            </ul>
        </nav>
    </header>
    
    <section id="about">
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am a web developer passionate about creating beautiful websites.</p>
    </section>
    
    <footer>
        <p>&copy; 2024 My Portfolio</p>
    </footer>
</body>
</html>
```

This serves as the backbone of your website.

## **Step 4: Adding CSS for Styling**

### **Basic Styling (`style.css`)**

```css
body {
    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    background-color: #f4f4f4;
    text-align: center;
}

header {
    background: #333;
    color: white;
    padding: 10px;
}

nav ul {
    list-style: none;
    padding: 0;
}

nav ul li {
    display: inline;
    margin: 0 10px;
}

nav ul li a {
    color: white;
    text-decoration: none;
}

section {
    padding: 20px;
}

footer {
    background: #333;
    color: white;
    padding: 10px;
    position: fixed;
    bottom: 0;
    width: 100%;
}
```

For better user experience, consider using a CSS framework like **Bootstrap**.

document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function() {
    console.log("Welcome to My Portfolio Website!");
});
```

JavaScript enhances interactivity, such as smooth scrolling, dynamic elements, and form validation.
